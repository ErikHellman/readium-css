## Utilities

We’ve been using house-made web apps during ReadiumCSS that we made available in the project’s repo:

- [Typeface Tester](utils/Typeface-tester.html), to help pick fonts for reading apps or alternatives for EPUB files;
- [Dynamic Leading Tester](utils/DynamicLeading-tester.html), to find the ideal line-height for a specified font.
