# User Overrides’ classification

[Implementers’ doc] [Authors’ info] [WIP]

In order to help you manage user settings, we defined 4 types of overrides: 

1. chrome (UI);
2. chrome advanced;
3. user overrides;
4. user overrides advanced.

Those types can help you decide which settings should be applied to every book, which should be implemented based on your UX approach or the first to be displayed in the customization panel, etc.

## Chrome

- Reading modes
- Paged/scrolled view

## Chrome advanced

- Number of columns
- Margins of the view (+ column gap)
- Custom reading modes (background and text color)
- Filters (darken and invert for night mode)

## User overrides

- Font-family
- Font-size

## User overrides advanced

- Line-height
- Text-align and hyphens (those two should probably work together)
- Paragraph spacing
- Paragraph indent
- Letter-spacing
- Word-spacing
- Arabic ligatures
- Type scale

Please note this classification might change and items could be added in the near future.
